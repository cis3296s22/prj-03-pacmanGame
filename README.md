# Pac-Man Game 
A fun throwback to the Pac-Man game with added modification features. As it stands, the Pac-Man game is not a complete version of the original nor was it the intention. Given the time frame we will adjust to make our own version of Pac-Man and jump right into adding features in. Below is a screenshot of a working Pac-Man game from a YouTube tutorial by gaspar coding channel. We will use this as a source to understand deeply the making of Pac-Man in order to create our own Pac-Man version.
