# How to run
- Make sure your computer or laptop is compiling and running with the same java version.
- Use latest java version if need be.
- If you encounter an error with running the jar files and you're running MacOS, try "export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 18)" replace 18 with the version you compiled the code with.

 Running

``` Open a terminal. Git clone the project repo. Navigate to the folder that has the jar file executable in it. Run it by typing the command "java -jar [filename].jar"```

Download the features from the release and move the jar files in the same level as the image folder. Double-check that you have all that is needed (e.g. Cat-Mouse-Cheese feature requires the cat.png and mouse.png).
